    exposes a function that gets-or-sets a unique id for a given entity

    TODO: we can use partial function application to bind an entity rather than
          have conditional logic sprinkeld per entity type as currently.

          none the same we'll need to constrain the allowed entity types,
          a clojure type-hierarchy would make sense "

  "from the database, returns, or sets and returns, an id for the given entity.
   the id is obtained through MySQL auto-increment, in case the entity is new to the database.
   as a race-condition with other threads can arise, if another thread already added our entity
   between the test and add phases, we just return its id already created through that thread (but
   this may waste an auto-increment in the table).

   as an alternative way to syncrhonize the unique creation of an id per entity, but without going to the database,
   we could possibly guard the two-phase process with a lock (but not a transaction, because of the auto-increment),
   roughly as follows:

       ```
       (def ^:private index-mirror-locker (Object.))
       (locking index-mirror-locker ..... )
       ```

   locks have their cost, but going to the database has a cost too. "
